  abstract = {The cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current mediates repolarization
	of the action potential and underlies the QT interval of the ECG.
	Mutations in either of the two molecular components of the rapid
	delayed rectifier (I(K,r)), HERG and KCNE2, have been linked to heritable
	or acquired long-QT syndrome. Mechanisms whereby mutations of KCNE2
	produce fatal cardiac arrhythmias characteristic of long-QT syndrome
	remain unclear. In this study, we characterize functional interactions
	between HERG and KCNE2 with a view to defining underlying mechanisms
	for action potential prolongation and long-QT syndrome. Whereas coexpression
	of hKCNE2 with HERG alters both kinetics and density of ionic current,
	incorporation of these effects into a quantitative model of the action
	potential predicts that only changes in current density significantly
	affect repolarization. Thus, the primary functional consequence of
	hKCNE2 on action potential morphology is through modulation of I(K,r)
	density, as predicted by the model. Mutations associated with long-QT
	syndrome that result only in modest changes of gating kinetics may
	be epiphenomena or may modulate action potential repolarization via
	interaction with alternative pore-forming potassium channel alpha
	subunits.},
