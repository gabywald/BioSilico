  abstract = {An artficial life entertainment-software product called Creatures
	was released in Europe in late 1996 and in the United States and
	Japan in mid-1997. When installed on a domestic computer (PC or Macintosh),
	each Creatures CD-ROM creates a virtual world in which autonomous
	software agents exist. The agents, known as ``norns'', interact with
	the human user, with each other, and with objects in their virtual
	world. Each norn coordinates perception and action via its own modular
	recurrent neural network: Each network has Hebbian learning, plus
	diffuse modulation of activity via a ``hormonal'' system that is
	part of that norn's ``biochemistry''. Details of each norn's neural
	network and biochemistry are genetically specified, and norns can
	breed via sexual reproduction. In the reproduction process, genetic
	material may be mutated and may also be subjected to ``gene duplications''
	that enable potentially unlimited increases in complexity of the
	norns' design. Over 500,000 Creatures CD-ROMS have now been sold.
	As each installed copy of Creatures can support 5 to 10 simultaneously
	existing individual norns, it seems reasonable to estimate that there
	are up to 5 million norns existing in the ``cyberspace'' provided
	by the global Creatures user community.
	
	Continued growth of the global norn population, to figures measured
	in tens of millions, is quite likely. Although a commercial product,
	the Creatures digital ecosystem should be of interest to artificial
	life scientists: There are obvious parallels with Yaeger's PolyWorld
	and Ray's NetTierra systems. This article provides a detailed discussion
	of the links between the artificial life literature and the technology
	used in Creatures and includes anecdotal discussion of the ``digital
	naturalism'' witnessed on the many independent websites maintained
	by Creatures enthusiasts.},

	Early in the 1980s Stephen Wolfram began to work in earnest upon cellular
	
	automata. These are a class of computer model which may be visualized
	
	as a set of memory locations, each containing one bit. These bits
	are
	
	updated in a succession of time steps. In each step, the new value
	of each
	
	bit depends upon the values of neighboring bits.      Wolfram particularly
	
	studied the class of automata in which all the bits are arranged upon
	a
	
	line, and each bit is updated using the very same functional dependence
	
	upon the bits at that site and its two nearest neighbors. There are
	2 5 6
	
	different automata of this type. Wolfram made it his business to study
	
	systematically all of these different automata, using extensive computer
	
	simulations, and to think about and generalize from what he thereby
	
	uncovered. A New Kind of Science, written and published by Stephen
	
	Wolfram, is the outcome of these, and related, studies.
	
	The book, hereafter described as NKS, is several things at once. First,
	it
	
	is an excellent pedagogical tool for introducing a reader, even one
	who has
	
	no knowledge of advanced mathematics, to some of the concepts of modern
	
	computer science, mathematics, and physics. Space-time diagrams of
	the
	
	bits generated by the model show four separate patterns: dull uniformity,
	
	periodic time-dependence, fractal behavior, and truly complex non-
	
	repetitive patterns.    A discussion of this classification, which
	I think is
	
	originally due to Wolfram, enables the author to introduce modern
	
	concepts of complexity. Using this he can discuss fractals, as they
	were
	
	introduced by Mandelbrot, the idea of universal computation, as it
	was
	
	developed by Turing, Church, and others, and describe the generation
	of
	
	complex patterns in a context in which one can actually see what is
	going
	
	on.    Teaching continues with the description of several kinds of
	
	computers, and of the conceptualization of natural processes as some
	kind
	
	of computation. This is a tour de force of clarity and simplicity.
	
	Since the book covers a huge territory it should not be surprising
	to find a
	
	few errors in it. For example in my own area of phase transitions
	NKS
	
	says, incorrectly, on page 981 that phase transitions involve a
	
	discontinuity in the partition function and on page 983 that symmetries
	
	are usually not important in phase transition problems--again false.
	
	Errors like these will, no doubt, be ironed out in subsequent editions.
	
	NKS is a very personal book. Again and again Wolfram tells the reader
	how
	
	he discovered some new fact about automata, or used the automata to
	
	construct a new illustration of old ideas, or how he used his knowledge
	of
	
	these systems to construct the beginning of new hypotheses about
	
	mathematics or science. These descriptions of the personal events
	in the
	
	development of Wolfram’s understanding are valuable both for the insights
	
	they give into the science involved and also for the way they reveal
	things
	
	about the author himself. This aspect of the book is truly unique.
	
	However the reporting of history is spotty, and sometimes quite weak.
	
	That weakness is partially structural in that the author has not allowed
	
	himself any footnotes in the text. Instead, at the back of the book
	there
	
	are three hundred and fifty pages of notes, including both descriptions
	of
	
	history and also additional information about the topics in the text.
	Any
	
	given topic might be covered at several different points. These notes
	do
	
	not contain any references either, they just give authors and sometimes
	
	dates. To find original sources one must look up a web site. I did
	not
	
	choose to do this. Because of this structure and an overuse of the
	words
	
	“discover” or “discovery” it is hard to distinguish between things
	which
	
	were explained previously by Wolfram and coauthors, well-known things
	
	here newly explained in the context of automata, or things which are
	
	genuinely new.      In fact the personal nature of the exposition
	often
	
	interferes with giving a full historical description. For example,
	I did
	
	find it interesting that the author devised an partially correct automaton
	
	description of hydrodynamic flow in 1973. But I, for one, also find
	it
	
	interesting to know that a model with some of the same virtues and
	
	defects was published by Jack Swift and myself in 1968 (Phys. Rev.
	1 6 5
	
	310) and even more interesting that a fully correct model was defined
	by
	
	Frisch, Hasslacher and Pomeau in 1986 (Phys. Rev. Lett. 56 1595).
	NKS
	
	does not help one learn the latter facts.
	
	Another structural difficulty arises from NKS’s use of a proprietary
	
	computer language in place of the usual mathematical notation. Since
	I
	
	am not fluent in the proprietary language, I cannot be sure about
	the
	
	meaning and correctness of the equations used.
	
	The remainder of this review is concerned with the NKS claim that
	its
	
	author has discovered a “new kind of science.” A “new science” claim
	is
	
	hardly new. One can find it in James Gleick’s excellent 1987 book
	Chaos,
	
	Making a New Science. The new science mentioned in that popularization
	
	also covers topics like the sensitive dependence upon initial conditions,
	
	the generation of strange attractors and of fractals, the onset of
	chaos,
	
	and complexity. Since neither Wolfram nor the other contemporaneous
	
	students of automata are even mentioned in this work, one might properly
	
	doubt that the Wolfram work from the early 1980s could be the new
	
	science under discussion.
	
	However, in that era automaton studies were rather divorced from the
	
	main stream of work in chaos and complexity. The leader of the main
	
	automaton group of that period was Edward Fredkin of MIT. His vision
	is
	
	described in the 1988 book Three Scientists and Their Gods by Robert
	
	Wright. This book describes the philosophical and some of the technical
	
	work of Fredkin and describes thinking which lies at the base of
	
	Wolfram’s world view. Fredkin especially stresses the idea that
	
	everything is a computation, and that the universe is a digital computer.
	In
	
	this book, Wolfram is mentioned only once (see page 62) when
	
	disagreements between the two scientists are emphasized. Thus neither
	
	Wright's nor Gleick's independent studies supports possible claims
	that
	
	Wolfram played a major role in making any “new kind of science” in
	the
	
	early 1980s or before.
	
	In the preface Wolfram says that the new kind of science was discovered
	
	in the period since 1991 and brought together in this volume. So we
	must
	
	look for them in the concepts, calculations, and theorems described
	for
	
	the first time in this book.   I found here interesting things that
	were new
	
	to me. NKS mentions but does not display a 1994 proof by Matthew Cook
	
	that one-dimensional automaton number 110 is a universal computer
	so
	
	that it could do any calculation that could be performed by a Turing
	
	machine. This so-far unpublished proof identifies a particularly simple
	
	automaton example of a Universal Turing machine. I think this is the
	
	                                      Some data included in NKS were
	also
	
	simplest example identified so far.
	
	new to me, especially counts of the proportion of automata of various
	
	kinds which fall into each of the four classes. It is interesting
	to see how
	
	the simplest systems are capable of generating chaos and universal
	
	behavior and to see how variation of a parameter could give rise to
	a
	
	transition from a mostly repetitive to a mostly chaotic behavior.
	    But
	
	these data mostly serve to illustrate well-known ideas.
	
	NKS chapter 9 contains provocative speculations related to how automaton
	
	models might incorporate quantum theory and gravity, via random network
	
	models and path independence. These speculations are, I think, new.
	The
	
	view that the universe is an automaton is due to Fredkin. But, the
	specific
	
	elements in the speculation emulate previous two dimensional quantum
	
	gravity theories and integrable systems work. This chapter describes
	a
	
	part-formed idea, exciting.... but not yet science.
	
	The book’s longest discussion is devoted to a Principle of Computational
	
	Equivalence, which roughly puts all chaotic calculations in the same
	
	category. This is a restatement and extension of Wolfram’s 1980s idea
	
	that classifies automaton outputs into four categories. So far this
	
	classification has proven neither subtle nor fruitful.
	
	The remaining apparently new material in the book is speculative,
	and
	
	appears to be even less worked out than the examples just mentioned.
	
	From my reading, I cannot support the view that any “new kind of science”
	
	is displayed in NKS. I see neither new kinds of calculations, nor
	new
	
	analytic theory, nor comparison with experiment.
	
	Per Bak’s 1997 book, How Nature Works, covers subjects similar to
	those
	
	of Gleick and NKS, and looks specifically at automaton studies and
	at
	
	Wolfram. Bak’s judgment is that “more than anyone, Stephen Wolfram,
	
	pointed out that these simple devices could be used as a laboratory
	for
	
	studying complex phenomena.” (page 106).       But he also said on
	page 107
	
	that “Wolfram never produced any theory of cellular automata.” And
	that
	
	is where the subject stands to this day.
