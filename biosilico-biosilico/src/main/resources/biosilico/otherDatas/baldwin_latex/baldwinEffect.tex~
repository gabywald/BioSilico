In several recent publications I have developped, from different points of view, some considerations which tend to bring out a certain influence at work in organic evolution which I venture to call ``a new factor''. I give below a list of references\footnote{\makereferences} to these publications and shall refer to them by number as this paper proceeds. The object of the present paper is to gather into one sketch an outline of the view of the process of development which these different publications have hinged upon.~\\

The problems involved in a theory of organic development may be gathered up under three great heads: Ontogeny, Phylogeny, Heredity. The general consideration, the ``factor'' which I propose to bring out, is operative in the first instance, in the field of \emph{Ontogeny}~; I shall consequently speak first of the problem of Ontogeny, then of that of Phylogeny, in so far as the topic dealt with makes it necessary, then of that of Heredity, under the same limitation, and finally, give some definitions and conclusion.~\\

\emph{Ontogeny : ``Organic Selection''} (see ref. 2, chap. vii) --- The series of facts which investigation in this field has to deal with are those of the individual's creature's development~; and two sorts of facts may be distinguished from the point of view of the \emph{function which an organism performs in the course of his life history}. There is, in the first place, the development of his heredity impulse, the unfolding of his heredity in the forms and functions which characterize the particular individual -- the phylogenetic variations, chich are constitutional to him~; and there is, in the second place, the series of functions, acts, etc., \emph{which he learns to do himself in the course of his life}. All of these latter, the \emph{special modifications which an organism undergoes during its ontogeny}, thrown together, have been called ``acquired characters'', and we may use that expression or adopt one recently suggested by Osborn~\footnote{Reported in \emph{Science}, April 3rd.; also used by him before N. Y. Acad. of Sci., April 13th. there is some confusion between the two terminations ``genic'' and ` genetic'' I think the proper distinction is that which reserves the former, ` genic'', for application in cases in which the word to which it is affixed qualifies a term used \emph{actively}, while the other, ``genetic'', conveys similarly a \emph{passive} signification~; thus agencies, causes, influences, etc., and ``ontogenic phylogenic, etc.'' while effects consequences, etc., and ``ontogenetic, phylogenetic, etc.''. }, ``ontogenic variations'' (except that I should prefer the form ``ontogenetic variations''), if the word variations seems appropriate at all.~\\

Assuming that there are such new or modified functions, in the first instance, and such ``acquired characters'', arising by the law of ``use and disuse'' from these new functions, our our farther question is about them. And the question is this: how does an organism come to be modified during his life history~?
