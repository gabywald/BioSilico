"Immortality" Genes

Modified Glucose --> Glycogen reactions.

    * Highlander Gene (identified by Strange Genes with help from slink)
      01 02 1C 00 00 03 03 3A 01 00 11 3B 01 23 38
      Now converts 3 glucose into 17 glycogen (instead of one).

    * Sweet Gene (identified by elemkay)
      01 02 1C 00 00 03 02 3A 01 00 01 3B 01 23 38
      Now converts 2 glucose (instead of three) into 1 glycogen.

    * Zeus Gene (identified by Strange Genes with help from slink)
      01 02 1C 00 00 03 01 3A 01 00 01 3B 01 23 38
      Now converts 1 glucose (instead of three) into 1 glycogen. 

Bacchus Gene

Modified 'Drive reducer - sex drive' reaction. Identified by Ricardo J. Mendez.

    01 02 21 00 00 07 01 2D 01 0D 01 39 01 00 08
    Now creates 1 starch instead of 1 reward when sex drive-- and sex drive are combined.

Gaia Gene

Modified Estrogen emitter. Identified and named by Monika Huebner.

    01 01 0C 00 02 17 01 02 00 3B 00 00 FF 00
    Now releases glycogen instead of estrogen -- resulting in an infertile immortal variation. 

Saturn Gene

Modified Coldness Emitter - causes uncontrollable 'shivering.' Identified by elemkay.

    01 01 07 00 00 07 01 04 00 04 00 18 32 00
    Site of attachment (third byte of the three byte locus of attachment) is now 'permanently active' instead of 'air is this cold.'
