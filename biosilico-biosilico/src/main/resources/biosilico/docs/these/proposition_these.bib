	Abstract = {An artficial life entertainment-software product called Creatures was released in Europe in late 1996 and in the United States and Japan in mid-1997. When installed on a domestic computer (PC or Macintosh), each Creatures CD-ROM creates a virtual world in which autonomous software agents exist. The agents, known as ``norns'', interact with the human user, with each other, and with objects in their virtual world. Each norn coordinates perception and action via its own modular recurrent neural network: Each network has Hebbian learning, plus diffuse modulation of activity via a ``hormonal'' system that is part of that norn's ``biochemistry''. Details of each norn's neural network and biochemistry are genetically specified, and norns can breed via sexual reproduction. In the reproduction process, genetic material may be mutated and may also be subjected to ``gene duplications'' that enable potentially unlimited increases in complexity of the norns' design. Over 500,000 Creatures CD-ROMS have now been sold. As each installed copy of Creatures can support 5 to 10 simultaneously existing individual norns, it seems reasonable to estimate that there are up to 5 million norns existing in the ``cyberspace'' provided by the global Creatures user community.

	Continued growth of the global norn population, to figures measured in tens of millions, is quite likely. Although a commercial product, the Creatures digital ecosystem should be of interest to artificial life scientists: There are obvious parallels with Yaeger's PolyWorld and Ray's NetTierra systems. This article provides a detailed discussion of the links between the artificial life literature and the technology used in Creatures and includes anecdotal discussion of the ``digital naturalism'' witnessed on the many independent websites maintained by Creatures enthusiasts.},

	Abstract = {In this work, an interaction model between artificial life agents
	(creatures) is proposed, which allows studying emergent social behavior
	of agents. This model describes the environment of artificial life
	and autonomous creatures in terms of goal-states, rules of behavior
	based on agents' goals and actions, initial knowledge and the use
	of communication instructions. For the case of study, the technology
	and environment of Creatures Labs are used to implement artificial
	life agents based on the proposed model. },

	Art and Entertainment Laurent Mignonneau and Christa Sommerer [Figures]
	Abstract This article consists of two sections: the first provides
	a brief overview of artificial-life art and entertainment software,
	some of the main products and their peculiarities; and the second
	describes one of the authors' artificial-life software products,
	called Life Spacies II, which was created between 1997 and 1999.
	This system consists of a web page that allows users to create artificial-life
	creatures by simply typing in text characters using a web page "editor."
	Written text is used as genetic code to model the creature's body.
	The body shape subsequently influences the creature's ability to
	move, which in turn determines the creature's behavior, survival
	and reproduction within the Life Spacies II environment. In addition,
	users of the system can feed the creatures with text characters and
	thus even more actively influence the creatures' survival and reproduction
	in their environment. An Overview of Artificial-Life Art and Entertainment
	Software Artists and designers have created artificial-life art software
	since the early 1990s. Much of the inspiration for creating digital
	life-forms on a computer screen has been provided by Richard Dawkins's
