Notes files for "biosilico/data/"

* ChemicalsList.txt : 
	- defines a list of 1000 (one thousand) 'chemicals' as simpliest as possible (name + description). 
* ChemicalsHalfLivesList.txt : 
	- defines some half-lives (others not defined have default values to 0). 
	- could be fusionned with "ChemicalsList.txt" but is not for some reasons : 
		- easiest way to test some decay due to half-lives configuration
		- easier configuration and maybe readability

* definedGenes.txt
* definedPathways.txt
