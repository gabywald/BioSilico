	57	Reward Echo	Reward chem must decay rapidly, this longer lasting chem is generated during that decay. Useful chem to monitor to see if reward has occurred. Biochemical use as a measure of 'recent' reward.
	58	Punish Echo	Punishment chem must decay rapidly, this longer lasting chem is generated during that decay. Useful chem to monitor to see if punishment has occurred. Biochemical use as a measure of 'recent' punishment.
	59	DecASH2	Decision layer Atrophy Suppressing Hormone - emitted by loose DEC DENS (type1) - stops further dec dens from atrophying, thus ensuring a minimal suppky of unallocated dens for new associations.
