General terms and definitions
BYTE

BYTE defines a single byte of data. An 8 bit unsigned integer, a BYTE can store whole numbers ranging from zero to 255.
Arrays
Arrays of bytes are defined as BYTE[SIZE] and contain SIZE bytes of data.
A Word about this document
This document is not meant to teach you genetics. Nor is it meant to tell you how to interpret the values within the genome. It is to explain the file format, and to give you a brief insight into how the genetics data is constructed, so that you can write utilities which operate on the genetics files.

The overall file format
The genetics file consists of a magic cookie of four characters at the beginning of the file, and then a series of genes, delimited by gene markers, terminated with an end token.

The cookie is:
BYTE [4] Cookie = 'd' 'n' 'a' '3'

The gene delimiter is
BYTE [4] Delimiter = 'g' 'e' 'n' 'e'

The end marker is
BYTE [4] EndMarker = 'g' 'e' 'n' 'd'
The genetic hierarchy

Creatures in Creatures 3 have genetically specified organs, which contain certain genes. These organs and the genes which the contain are in a certain configuration within the genetics files.

Biochemical Reactions, Receptors and Emitters all belong to the organ which was last defined. If no organ has yet been defined then they are considered "orphaned" and belong to the implied "body" organ. Brain lobes belong to the "TheBrain Organ" and again, if no brain organ definition has been encountered then they are "orphaned" and belong to the next brain organ to be defined. Note that should you define multiple Brain Organs, only the very last one to be defined will be expressed. A creature can have only one brain.

There must be only one "Creature/Genus" gene, which must be gene zero in the file. If this is not so, then the genetics file is invalid.

All other types of genes belong to the body and their order does not matter.
The structure of a gene

Genes each have a header, and a body. The header is of a fixed length, the body of the gene varies in length between gene types, but is consistent within a gene type.
The gene Header BYTE GeneType

BYTE GeneSubType
BYTE GeneID
BYTE Generation
BYTE SwitchOnTime
BYTE Sex-Dependance/Mutability-Flags
BYTE MutabilityWeighting
BYTE Expression Variant
The Generation, SwitchOn and Flags entries

The generation byte indicates how many times this gene has been duplicated. The switch on time ranges from 0 (embryo) to 6 (senile). The flags entry is a bit field which is arranged as follows.
Bit 	7 	6 	5 	4 	3 	2 	1 	0
Meaning 	Reserved 	Reserved 	Not Expressed 	Female Only* 	

Male Only*
	Deletable 	Duplicable 	Mutable
The Mutability Weighting entry

currently undocumented.... oooooooooh...
Brain Genes (Type 00)

There are three types of brain genes, the first is the brain lobe (Type 00 00), the second, the brain organ (type 00 01), and the third the brain tract (type 00 02).

Biochemistry Genes (Type 01)

The biochemistry genes govern the functions of the chemicals within the body. They govern reactions, interfaces between the brain and the chemicals, and much, much more.
Biochemical Receptors (Type 01 00 - Size 8)

The biochemical receptors latch onto a locus within the brain or the current organ, and provide feedback to the brain about chemicals within the body.

BYTE Organ
BYTE Tissue
BYTE Locus
BYTE Chemical
BYTE Threshold
BYTE Nominal
BYTE Gain
BYTE Flags

The flags indicate if the receptor output is inverted (1) or if it is digital (2).

A digital receptor has its state calculated as:

Output = Nominal Â± Gain If Signal>Threshold
Biochemical Emitters (Type 01 01 - Size 8)

Emitters tie to loci2 as do receptors. They read the value of the locus, and emit chemicals based on their input states.

BYTE Flags

The Emitter flags can be: 1: Clear input signal after reading or 2: Invert Input Signal

The Pose String can be generated from the Pose Editor.
Creature Gait (Type 02 04 - Size 9)

This is a collection of poses which show movement.

BYTE GaitNumber //A Drive
BYTE [8] PoseSequence

Organs are the genes which specify the organ properties. Organs include the heart, skin, bones etc.
Organs Organ (Type 03 00 - Size 5)

These have the same structure as the Brain Organ. Organs contain all the receptors, emitters and reactions listed after them in the genetics file (or until another organ gene is encountered). Reactions etc, contained within the organ, will only function whilst the organ is alive.

BYTE ClockRate
BYTE RepairRate
BYTE BioTickStart
