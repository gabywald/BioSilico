Linking to SRS

This document describes how to add hyperlinks from your own pages to the EBI SRS server. We strive to maintain links to older versions of SRS working and will continue to do so in the future. However, SRS is evolving all the time and users need to be aware of changes to the SRS syntax. This page describes some of these changes.
Supported links and Services at EBI

If you have an entry identifier (i.e. entry Id or accession number) for which you want to retrieve an entry then we suggest you consider using one of the following services:

    EBI Fetch Tools:
        dbfetch - E.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch/dbfetch?db=EMBL&id=hscfos&style=raw
        emblfetch - get entries from EMBL
        medlinefetch - get entries from MEDLINE
        pdbfetch - get entries from PDB
        swissfetch - get entries from UniProt
        WSDbfetch - SOAP based Web Services interface to dbfetch

For more complex queries many EBI resources offer REST and SOAP based Web Services interfaces, for example:

    EBI Search:
        EB-eye SOAP Web Service
    ENA Browser:
        ENA Browser REST URLs
    UniProt:
        uniprot.org REST interface (documentation), e.g. http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/fos_human.txt
        UniProtJAPI a client-side Java API for accessing UniProt.

See EBI Web Services for more resources which provide Web Services interfaces.
Program and Script Usage

Important: resources at EBI are not unlimited and many users are using the services concurrently. Therefore, we ask that you set a pause or wait of 3-5 seconds in between individual requests in your scripts or programs. Occasionally we may have to black-list a user, host or IP address in order to ensure fair access to the service for all.

We also impose limits on memory and CPU usage. Currently wgetz jobs are limited to a maximum of 4GB of memory and 5 min of runtime. This may lead to truncation or failure of some large requests. So remember to check that you have the expected number of results.

We recommend that programs and scripts use the -noSession option unless they use session specific features (e.g. query history).

For other considerations, and useful resources, when using developing programs which use our SRS server please see SRS URL API.
Virtual Libraries
What are Virtual Libraries?

These are virtual SRS databanks that join multiple databases of the same type (i.e EMBLRELEASE with EMBLNEW, MEDLINE2006 with MEDLINENEW, etc.). Virtual Libraries simplify the linking process by executing a virtual query on two or more libraries.
Old and New queries

If you have an SRS query that searched the EMBLRELEASE and EMBLNEW databases but displayed only the latest entries:

(q=[libs={emblrelease emblnew}-id:foobar])!(q<emblnew)))

it is possible to do this query using the EMBL virtual library like this:

[embl-id:foobar]

There is NO need to specify any of the member libraries.
Which Virtual Libraries exist on this SRS server

    EMBL = EMBLRELEASE + EMBLNEW + EMBLWGS
    EMBLWGS = EMBLWGSRELEASE + EMBLWGSNEW
    EMBLCON = EMBLCONRELEASE + EMBLCONNEW
    EMBLANN = EMBLANNRELEASE + EMBLANNNEW
    EMBLCONEXP = EMBLCONEXPRELEASE + EMBLCONEXPNEW
    MEDLINE = MEDLINE2006 + MEDLINENEW
    SWALL = UNIPROT
    PATENT_PRT = EPO_PRT + JPO_PRT + USPO_PRT
    REFSEQ = REFSEQGENREL + REFSEQGENNEW
    REFSEQP = REFSEQPROTREL + REFSEQPROTNEW
    RHDB = RHDBMAIN + RHDBNEW

Linking to SRS
SRS query language

Most links to SRS are performing a query or retriving an entry. In these cases the URL created will contain an SRS query. If you are not familar with the SRS query language you may find it useful to read our SRS Query Language Quick Guide before reading the rest of this document.
Character escapes

Many non-alphanumeric characters have special meanings in URLs and have to be escaped. For most characters the standard URL escapes can be used, which is a '%' followed by the hex ASCII value for the character e.g. %20 for space, %23 for '#', etc. However in SRS query strings sometimes the standard escapes will not work and wgetz character escapes have to be used instead:
Char 	wgetz escape
& 	_AMP_
= 	_EQ_
# 	_HASH_
% 	_PERC_
+ 	_PL_
<space> 	_SP_
Common syntax

With no session (this will strip away the SRS interface):

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wgetz?-noSession+-e+[EMBL-id:V01512]

With no session (this will strip away the SRS interface) and in plain text (no html):

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wgetz?-noSession+-e+[EMBL-id:V01512]+-ascii

With no session, getting all pax6 entries from UniProt in Fasta format:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-noSession+[uniprot-id:pax6_*]+-view+FastaSeqs

With a session (SRS WWW interface will show):

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wgetz?-id+sessionid+-e+[EMBL-id:V01512]+-view+EmblEntry

With a specific layout (-view) and session:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wgetz?-id+sessionid+[medline-id:12519939]+-view+MedlineRef

With a specific layout (-view) and no session:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wgetz?-noSession+[medline-id:12519939]+-view+MedlineRef

Common errors

    Using -id without a session id worked on SRS 7.1. This was a bug. It has been fixed in the current release.
    Using a non existent session Id will create the session, this may not be what was intended
    Using [libs={embl emblnew}-id:bla] - EMBL is a Virtual library that includes EMBLRELEASE, EMBLWGS and EMBLNEW.
    Using [libs={embl emblwgs}-id:bla] - EMBLWGS is part of EMBL. Use [embl-id:bla]

Examples of linking to SRS

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-id+blabla+-e+%5bprosite-des:actin%5d%3Einterpro
Field information

The fields that are indexed for a database can be viewed in the drop down menu of the query form or on the database information page. For example the database information page for EMBLRELEASE. The fields that are indexed are shown in the table. The short name code (usually three letters) for each field is what must be used in the URL to query or display a particular field. The short name code is always the second column in the table that gives general information about a database.

Examples: Division:div, Accession number:acc, NCBI TaxId:txi, Keywords:key
More about views

Note: View names are case sensitive, i.e. SeqSimpleView and seqsimpleview are not equivalent. Database names and field names in the query string are not case sensitive.
System specific views

There are a number of predefined views available in SRS for any given database. To determine what views are available, have a look at the drop down menu called 'View results using' in the left hand side column after performing a query.These views can be used in the call to wgetz and must be used after the parameter -view. So for example, to use the view 'UniParcSimple' the URL would look like:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-id+newId+-e+[UNIPARC:'UPI0000000001']+-view+UniParcSimple

or to use the FastaSeqs view:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-id+newId+-e+[uniprot-org:gallus]+-view+FastaSeqs

User defined views

A user can choose to make their own view to display particular fields for any given database. To make a user defined view, select the 'views' tab on the top tool bar. From the menu, 'Databanks to define a view for', select a databank(s). Name the view on the left. Then select create new view. On this page, select the fields for the view and save it. The view is then available for the duration of the session. Remember that temporary sessions last only 24 hours before they are deleted. Permanent sessions are maintained. If you need to retrieve data using wgetz and a pre-defined view on a regular basis, you will need to define the view in a permanent session. Example using a predefined view (called testView) for EMBL displaying the id, accession number, division, molecule, description, keywords and organsim and a permanet session (testSession):

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-id+PERMtestSession+embl-id+[AK033621|AK078912]+-view+testView

alternatively, a user may list the fields (same as above) that they want to display in the query string using the -f parameter and sperating each field by a space:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-id+PERMtestSession+[embl-id:AK033621|AK078912]+-f+id%20acc%20div%20mol%20des%20key%20org

Chunking Results

Using the -bv and -lv options the results of a query can be split into chunks. This can be very useful for downloading very large sets or retriving data through complex views. When using a view it may be necessary to specifiy a page to get the -bv option to work correctly, see Useful pages for details of the available pages.
Example

First chunk of ten, i.e. from entry 1 get 10 entries:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-noSession+-ascii+-e+-bv+1+-lv+10+[uniprot-des:auxin*]

Second chunk of ten, i.e. from entry 11 get 10 entries:

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-noSession+-ascii+-e+-bv+11+-lv+10+[uniprot-des:auxin*]

Result Count

To get just the number of results matching a query you can use the cResult page.

Note: this feature is an EBI modification and is not available in other SRS servers.
Example

http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-noSession+-page+cResult+-ascii+[uniprot-all:auxin*]

Useful Pages

Useful pages you may wish to specify:

    qResult: the results page
    EntryPage: a single entry page
    LibInfo: databank information, used with -lib to specify the databank
    query: the Standard Query Form, used with -l to specify the databank
    databanks: the List of Databanks page
    saveQResult: (EBI only) a plain page, no header or sidebar, used as a workaround for issues with chunking support (-bv bug)

SRS 5 URLs

If you have existing SRS 5 style URLs please note:

The -fun option is no longer supported, the following table details the equivalent -page options for the most commonly used names:
SRS 5 -fun 	SRS 7 -page
-fun+PageQueryForm+-l+SWISSPROT 	-page+query+-l+SWISSPROT
-fun+PageLibInfo+-info+SWISSPROT 	-page+LibInfo+-lib+SWISSPROT
-fun+PageLibInfo+-l+SWISSPROT 	-page+LibInfo+-lib+SWISSPROT
-fun+PageLibList 	-page+databanks

Note: SRS 7 page names are case sensitive unlike SRS 5 “function” names.

Please use URLs without version numbers (i.e. http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srsbin/cgi-bin/wgetz) instead of ones containing specific version numbers.
