EMBL-Bank format

The main EMBL-Bank format is the flatfile format, which is defined in full detail in the EMBL-Bank User Manual. EMBL-Bank records are available in flatfile and other formats, namely Fasta and XML, through the ENA Browser. The EMBL-Bank sequence feature annotation usage and interpretation is defined by the INSDC Feature Table Document, which is also made available through the Feature Table Browser.

EMBL-Bank data classes

Please refer to the table below for a summary of EMBL-Bank data classes and supported formats. The 'Example' column contains example entries retrieved from the ENA Browser in HTML, XML, Fasta, and flatfile formats. The ENA Browser provides retrieval and visualisation functionality over ENA data and metadata and uses REST URLs to support both interactive and programmatic access. Please note that all EMBL-Bank data classes use the same flatfile format and are constrained by the same XML Schema: ENA.embl.xsd. Please also note that all XML documents returned by the ENA Browser are included in and validate against the ENA.root.xsd XML Schema.
