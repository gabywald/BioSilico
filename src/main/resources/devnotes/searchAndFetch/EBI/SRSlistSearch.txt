List Search

The List Search on the “Quick Search” page allows you to perform a search with a list of SRS entry IDs.

Note:

    Each ID must occur on a single line.
    The IDs must be in the format SrsDatabank:EntryId.
    Up to 500 IDs will be searched per request.

ID Format

The list of IDs to be used with the List Search should be formatted as one ID per line and each ID should be of the form:
	SrsDatabank:EntryId

This is case insensitive so the following examples are all equivalent:
    UNIPROT:104K_THEAN
    UniProt:104K_THEAN
    uniprot:104k_thean

SRS Databank Name

Databanks in SRS can have two names:

    Name (e.g. “SWISSPROT”)
    Display name (e.g. “UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot”)

The display name is optional, and if it is not defined the name will be always used.

For the “List Search” the databank name, not the display name, must be used. To find the databank name look on the “Databank Information” page for the databank. You can find this by following the link on the “Library Page” or from the “Databanks” page.
Entry ID

The ID used for an entry in SRS is not always the item in the ID field. For some databanks the Accession field is used instead. To find out which field is used for the SRS ID look on the “Databank Information” page for the databank in the list of fields. The field which is of type id is the field used for the SRS entry ID.
Examples
UniProtKB

For UniProtKB the SRS databank name is UNIPROT so using it as a database prefix:
	UNIPROT:104K_THEAN
	UNIPROT:104K_THEPA
	UNIPROT:108_SOLLC
	UNIPROT:10KD_VIGUN
	UNIPROT:110KD_PLAKN

EMBL-Bank

For EMBL-Bank the SRS databank name is EMBL so using it as a database prefix:
	EMBL:BW633289
	EMBL:BW633290
	EMBL:BW633291
	EMBL:BW633292
	EMBL:BW633293

EMBL (Release)

For EMBL (Release) the SRS databank name is EMBLRELEASE so using it as a database prefix:
	EMBLRELEASE:AJ879808
	EMBLRELEASE:AJ879809
	EMBLRELEASE:AJ879810
	EMBLRELEASE:AJ879812
	EMBLRELEASE:AJ879813

Mixed Set

More than one databank can be queried for example a mixed set of UniProtKB, PDB and IPI entries:
	UNIPROT:AFB2_ARATH
	UNIPROT:AFB3_ARATH
	PDB:1LR5
	IPI:IPI00516468.1
	PDB:1LRH
	IPI:IPI00517307.1
