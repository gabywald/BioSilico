EFetch documenation is also available for the Literature, and Taxonomy databases.

EFetch: Retrieves records in the requested format from a list of one or more unique identifiers.

Base URL: http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi

URL parameters:
NOTE: Utility parameters may be case sensitive. Use lower case characters for all parameters except WebEnv
	Database (db)
	Web Environment (WebEnv)
	Query key (query_key)
	Record Identifiers (id)
	Tool (tool)
	E-mail address (email)
	Display Numbers (retstart, retmax)
	Report formats and specifiers (rettype, retmode):
		Retrieval Type and Mode for sequence databases
		Retrieval Type and Mode for genome databases
		Retrieval Type and Mode for SNP database
		Retrieval Type and Mode for SRA database

Database
Current database values:
	gene
	snp
	popset
		sequences:
		genome
		nucleotide:
			nuccore
			nucest
			nucgss
		protein
	sra
Example:
db=protein

Web Environment (WebEnv)
History link value previously returned in XML results from ESearch and used with EFetch in place of primary ID result list.
Example:
WebEnv=NCID_1_23402205_210.26.30.681_3051_6265373359

Query Key
The value used for a history search number or previously returned in XML results from Esearch or EPost.
Example:
query_key=6
Note: WebEnv is similar to the cookie that is set on a user's computers when accessing PubMed on the web.  If the parameter usehistory=y is included in an ESearch URL both a WebEnv (cookie string) and query_key (history number) values will be returned in the results. Rather then using the retrieved PMIDs in an ESummary URL you may simply use the WebEnv and query_key values to retrieve the records. WebEnv will change for each ESearch query.

Record Identifier
IDs required if WebEnv is not used.
Current values:
	NCBI sequence number (GI)
	accession
	accession.version
	fasta
	genome ID
	GeneID
	seqid
Example:
id=123,U12345,U12345.1,gb|U12345|

Tool
A string with no internal spaces that identifies the resource which is using Entrez links (e.g., tool=flybase). This argument is used to help NCBI provide better service to third parties generating Entrez queries from programs. As with any query system, it is sometimes possible to ask the same question different ways, with different effects on performance. NCBI requests that developers sending batch requests include a constant 'tool' argument for all requests using the utilities.
Example:
tool=flybase

E-mail Address
If you choose to provide an email address, we will use it to contact you if there are problems with your queries or if we are changing software interfaces that might specifically affect your requests. If you choose not to include an email address we cannot provide specific help to you,  but you can still sign up for utilities-announce to receive general
announcements.
Example:
email=john@doe.org

Display Numbers
	retstart - sequential number of the first id retrieved - default=0 which will retrieve the first record
	retmax - number of items retrieved
Example:
retstart=100&retmax=50


Retrieval Type and Mode

Sequence Strand, Start, Stop and Complexity Parameters
	strand - what strand of DNA to show (1 = plus or 2 = minus)
	seq_start - show sequence starting from this base number
	seq_stop - show sequence ending on this base number
	complexity - gi is often a part of a biological blob, containing other gis
	Complexity regulates the display:
		0 - get the whole blob
		1 - get the bioseq for gi of interest (default in Entrez)
		2 - get the minimal bioseq-set containing the gi of interest
		3 - get the minimal nuc-prot containing the gi of interest
		4 - get the minimal pub-set containing the gi of interest
	
Example:
strand=2&seq_start=50&seq_stop=2000&complexity=2
