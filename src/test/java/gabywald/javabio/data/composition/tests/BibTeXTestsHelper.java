		"  abstract = {The cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current mediates repolarization\n"+
		"	of the action potential and underlies the QT interval of the ECG.\n"+
		"	Mutations in either of the two molecular components of the rapid\n"+
		"	delayed rectifier (I(K,r)), HERG and KCNE2, have been linked to heritable\n"+
		"	or acquired long-QT syndrome. Mechanisms whereby mutations of KCNE2\n"+
		"	produce fatal cardiac arrhythmias characteristic of long-QT syndrome\n"+
		"	remain unclear. In this study, we characterize functional interactions\n"+
		"	between HERG and KCNE2 with a view to defining underlying mechanisms\n"+
		"	for action potential prolongation and long-QT syndrome. Whereas coexpression\n"+
		"	of hKCNE2 with HERG alters both kinetics and density of ionic current,\n"+
		"	incorporation of these effects into a quantitative model of the action\n"+
		"	potential predicts that only changes in current density significantly\n"+
		"	affect repolarization. Thus, the primary functional consequence of\n"+
		"	hKCNE2 on action potential morphology is through modulation of I(K,r)\n"+
		"	density, as predicted by the model. Mutations associated with long-QT\n"+
		"	syndrome that result only in modest changes of gating kinetics may\n"+
		"	be epiphenomena or may modulate action potential repolarization via\n"+
		"	interaction with alternative pore-forming potassium channel alpha\n"+
