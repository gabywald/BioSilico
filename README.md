# BioSilico

Some ideas about Artificial Life, Creatures (game series) and Neural Networks. Rare review to make this working with Maven / Java 8 / in a GitHub Repository ! (i.e. some file reading in relative path). 

Probably out-of-date for some reasons (but many ideas inside), codes from 2008-2012 (and before then) ; ideas I didn't continue for times spent reasons and I wish to continue (year 2020). 

Tests and learning on coding / programming (Java, Perl, I did some HyperTalk / HyperCard before that long ago) ; some studies on biochemistry and video games (Myst, Marathon, and the first Creature game) then bioinformatics. Find some old code here !
