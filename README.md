# BioSilico

Some ideas about Artificial Life, Creatures (game series) and Neural Networks. Rare review to make this working with Maven / Java 8 / in a GitHub Repository ! (i.e. some file reading in relative path). 

Probably out-of-date for some reasons (but many ideas inside), codes from 2008-2012 (and before then) ; ideas I didn't continue for times spent reasons and I wish to continue (year 2020). 

Tests and learning on coding / programming (Java, Perl, I did some HyperTalk / HyperCard before that long ago) ; some studies on biochemistry and video games (Myst, Marathon, and the first Creature game) then bioinformatics. Find some old code here ! And reviewed so far. 

Some parts where done in Java 1.4 (before the Generics of Java 1.5) ! Some review for generics and some other for stream (Java 8 !). Adding some unit tests and more review !

## Adding and notes

Units Tests ; review...

For dev on BioSilico : 

* genetic execution / genes use  age and cycle (to avoid multiple instantiation of Brain / BrainLobe ++ execution of InitConcGene) : make good usage of ageMin and ageMax (0, 0) for initiation at start / 'birth'. 
* Design Patterns 'Builder' to make better implements
* ...

## Ant Hill Example

First Aim was to do / retake an example with Ants, ans some plants and fruits. Not totally from scratch / from nothing : it gives some ideas about how the engine could works. 

## Creatures (Game Series) ressources

Some (original) ideas comes from here, some articles, documentations, ressources...
