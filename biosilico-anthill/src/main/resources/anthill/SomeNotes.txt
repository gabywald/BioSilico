20200803 : NRJ ideas / notes
	energy variables on chemicals for World / WorldCase (on some ?!) : 
		- 'relative' heat (warm, cold...)
		- 'solar' or equivalent
		- ... 

	energy equivalent in Agent / Organism : 
		- 'dissipation' or 'accumulation' (same index as in environment)
		- molecular (ATP, ADP...) : made by "photosynthesis" or use of molecules
		- ... 

	'energy source' : 
		- specific type of Agent which gives energy in a local WorldCase instance
		- not alive, not eatable, not movable (see later for other purposes)
		- ... 
		
20200805+ 
	Export and build of Decision / IDecision / DecisionBuilder
	Reproduction according to 'main type' of organism (Daemon, Viridita, Anima, Bacta, Viria)
		TypeOf to decide which kind of reproduction
		decision to 'mate' + 'lay egg' separately ! (create an egg)
		create gamets to be used as agents / organism ? (not alive, eatable ?, movable ?)
	Pheromone detection : 
		StimulusDecision (localition => variable)
		EmitterReceptor (variable => input neuron)
		Instinct (connexion between input neuron and output neuron)
	Brain & BrainLobeS !!
	
20200831
	Review and do some basic pathways (with O2, CO2, H20, Glucose, Fructose...)
	Review and do some basic Neural NetWork ("HardCoded" with Instinct, evolution and adding will come !)
	Make a Basic Example of an Ant
	Make a Basic Example of a Plant
	... 

20200901 : 
	 * StimulusDecision, Some explanations :
	 * ***** perception : apply detection on WorldCase and chemicals of current organism
	 * (perception) && (object) => if (number of AgentType (indicator||attribute) > threshold) => set value at variable (else 0)
	 * (perception) && ( ! object) => if (indicator at direction attribute > threshold) => set value at variable (else 0)
	 * ***** not perception : chemicals of current organism then (if apply) decision 
	 * ( ! perception) && (object) => if (indicator > threshold) => Decision !
	 * ( ! perception) && ( ! object) => if (variable > threshold) => Decision !
	 
 	 * EmitterReceptor, Some explanations (works only if Brain present and position of Neuron not null) :
	 * (internal) && (receptor) => if (internal variable >= threshold) => activity at (x, y) increase by put
	 * (internal) && ( ! receptor) => if (activity at (x, y) >= threshold) => internal variable increase by put
	 * ( ! internal) && (receptor) => if (WorldCase variable >= threshold) => activity at (x, y) increase by put
	 * ( ! internal) && ( ! receptor) => if (activity at (x, y) >= threshold) => external variable increase by put

20200831 NOTES : 
Some review to be done here to make following : 
- If has no Fruit on carrying : deposit Pheromone_00 ; deposit Pheromone_01 otherwise
- If has no Fruit on carrying : detect and moving to a WorldCase with Fruits ; otherwise nothing
- If has no Fruit on carrying : detect and moving to Pheromone_00 ; otherwise Pheromone_01
- Search for some mate if fertile !
- When fertile and has enough gamets (QUEEN) : do not move and produce Pheromone_01, and EGGs, and LAY_EGG
- Soldiers not for now ! 
- Evolution / Aging from EGG to LARVA to WORKER to QUEEN (if apply)
- Consume some Fruit if necessary (define hunger ? not enough Glucose / Glycogen ?) ; 
- Deposit Fruits when in AntHill (high level of Pheromone_01)
- ... 

20200902 NOTES : 
- Prioritization of "searching food" versus "back to AntHill with food" (more for this one) : stronger signal !
- more signal for "has food" => transmission => using WTA => flares taking decision(s) about using Pheromone_01 (and following it)
- other solution (cost more !) => negative transmission and / or negative detection !
- "Detection" Input Lobes : 
- connection with StimulusDecision for Pheromone_00 (all directions)	=> 9 [ch700-ch709]
- connection with StimulusDecision for Pheromone_01 (all directions)	=> 9 [ch710-ch719]
- connection with StimulusDecision for FOOD (all directions)			=> 9 [ch720-ch729]
- connection with StimulusDecision for "has FOOD"						=> 1 [cg730]
- Differents levels of threshold detection (AntHill VERY High for PHEROMONE_01 because of QUEEN !!)
- ... 
- Decision Lobe(s) : 
- WTA group 1 : EmitterReceptor emit PHERONOMONE_00 __OR__ EmitterReceptor emit PHERONOMONE_01
- WTA group 2 : [MOVE_TO for each direction] __OR__ GET (food) __OR__ DROP(food) __OR__ MOVE_AWAY
- to put later : 
- EAT
- "hunger detection"

20200905 NOTES : 
- Brain and BrainLobes : groups of WTA neurones for "incompatible decisions"
- EmitterReceptor as receptor for Stimulus => "first lines of BrainLobe"
- EmitterReceptor as emitter for Stimulus => "last lines of BrainLobe"
- Instinct between the two lines (different weights to apply priorities)
- StimulusDecision as "not receptor" to take decision

202020907 NOTES :
- Brain :  
	- 0	[0-26]	(heigth of 1)	DirW detect Ph_00
	- 1	[0-26]	(heigth of 1)	DirW detect Ph_01
	- 2	[0-26]	(heigth of 1)	DirW detect FOOD
	- 3	[0-15]	(heigth of 1)	Pheromones Inputs (use for some Decisions, "HAS FOOD" for example)
	- 10	[0-30] (heigth of 10)	"Concept Lobe I"
	- 10	[0-30] (heigth of 10)	"Concept Lobe II"
	- 90	[0-26]	Decision MOVE_TO DirW
	- 90	[50+]	Other decisions

20200910 NOTES : 
	For treatment in brain via with decision with treatment in Brain, indications for a "Meta Builder" of pathways / group of genes
	StimulusDecision in Input => EmitterReceptor (receptor) => InputNeuron => Instinct's [=> Concept Neuron's => Instincts =>]* => OutPutNeuron => EmitterReceptor ( ! receptor) => StimulusDecision (decision)
	At Least 6 Genes !

20200915 NOTES : 
	Decision action : Chemical variable beyond threshold (and launching process of decision make less of this varaibel value). 
	Biochemistry : 
		"classic" biochemistry : Krebs cycle at least !
		taking "Digestive and Repertory System", biochemistry of Creatures
			Starch => Glucose
			Hexokinase + Glucose => H20 + C02
			Glucose => Glycogen
			Glycogen => Glucose
			Hunger process ?
			Chemoreceptors for DEATH
			Neuron driven ?

20200917 NOTES : 
	Using ideas from Creatures about simple BioChemistry (to get better in the future). 
	Adding Hexokinase when really moving ! (then use it with glucose after that !)
	How an Agent / Organism Died ? Excess of some chemicals ! (i.e. hexokinase, aging ?!)
		DEATH comes from overdose from AGING (exceed 998)
		DEATH comes from overdose from CO2 (exceed ???)
		DEATH comes from overdose from GLUCOSE (exceed ???)
	Aging, passing from status to status
		age of application for some gene 
			(0:0 for Brain, BrainLobe, Instinct (exceptions !)...)
			Decision to lay egg
			Detection for some actions / passing
... 

20220118 NOTES : 
	Reactions have to use more Energy ?!
	Plants have to export Water ?!
	Plants have to import CO2 ?!
	Use a CO2 generator for tests in BioSilico Util ??
	... 
	
20220119 NOTES : 
	Analyse data and graphical representations. 
	Further analysis. 
	Choice of genes to add and analyse evolutions. 
	Automatic detector of such "anomalies". ?? (XXX to do)
	Generator of mutations for evolving new Basic Genomes. 
	See for next version(s) (new tests).
