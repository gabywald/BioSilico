20200803 : NRJ ideas / notes
	energy variables on chemicals for World / WorldCase (on some ?!) : 
		- 'relative' heat (warm, cold...)
		- 'solar' or equivalent
		- ... 

	energy equivalent in Agent / Organism : 
		- 'dissipation' or 'accumulation' (same index as in environment)
		- molecular (ATP, ADP...) : made by "photosynthesis" or use of molecules
		- ... 

	'energy source' : 
		- specific type of Agent which gives energy in a local WorldCase instance
		- not alive, not eatable, not movable (see later for other purposes)
		- ... 
		
20200805+ 
	Export and build of Decision / IDecision / DecisionBuilder
	Reproduction according to 'main type' of organism (Daemon, Viridita, Anima, Bacta, Viria)
		TypeOf to decide which kind of reproduction
		decision to 'mate' + 'lay egg' separately ! (create an egg)
		create gamets to be used as agents / organism ? (not alive, eatable ?, movable ?)
	Pheromone detection : 
		StimulusDecision (localition => variable)
		EmitterReceptor (variable => input neuron)
		Instinct (connexion between input neuron and output neuron)
	Brain & BrainLobeS !!

	Review and do some basic pathways (with O2, CO2, H20, Glucose, Fructose...)
	Review and do some basic Neural NetWork ("HardCoded" with Instinct, evolution and adding will come !)
	Make a Basic Example of an Ant
	Make a Basic Example of a Plant
	...
