	energy variables on chemicals for World / WorldCase (on some ?!) : 
		- 'relative' heat (warm, cold...)
		- 'solar' or equivalent
		- ... 

	energy equivalent in Agent / Organism : 
		- 'dissipation' or 'accumulation' (same index as in environment)
		- molecular (ATP, ADP...) : made by "photosynthesis" or use of molecules
		- ... 

	'energy source' : 
		- specific type of Agent which gives energy in a local WorldCase instance
		- not alive, not eatable, not movable (see later for other purposes)
		- ...
